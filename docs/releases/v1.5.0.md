# Release Notes - v1.5.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-27

## Overview

Gantt Editor v1.5 introduces professional-grade features that elevate the product from "usable" to "professional-grade". This release focuses on project baseline comparison, advanced export capabilities, resource management, and improved time display.

## New Features

### 1. Project Baseline 📌
Save project baseline as a milestone and visually compare planned vs actual progress.

**Features:**
- One-click baseline save with confirmation
- Gray baseline bars rendered below task bars
- Deviation calculation: "Delayed X days" or "Ahead X days"
- Persistent state across page reloads

**Usage:**
1. Click "Save Baseline" button in toolbar
2. Confirm to save current project state
3. Toggle "Show Baseline" to compare progress

### 2. Advanced Export 🖼️
Export complete Gantt chart as high-quality PNG images.

**Features:**
- Export Current View: Quick screenshot
- Export Full Gantt: Long image with canvas stitching
- Progress indicator with real-time percentage
- Automatic smart_rendering toggle for complete capture

**Usage:**
1. Click Export dropdown in toolbar
2. Choose export type
3. Wait for progress (5-30s for large projects)
4. Image downloads automatically

### 3. Resource Conflict Detection 👤
Automatically detect and highlight resource overload situations.

**Features:**
- Workload calculation: 8 hours/day threshold
- Hour-level precision for small tasks
- Visual feedback: Orange border on conflicting tasks
- Detailed tooltip: assignee, date, hours, overload

**How It Works:**
- System calculates daily workload per assignee
- Tasks causing >8 hours/day are marked with conflict
- Updates automatically when tasks change

### 4. Time Display Optimization ⏱️
Human-readable duration display with full i18n support.

**Features:**
- Localized format: "1 天 4 小时" (zh-CN) vs "1d 4h" (en-US)
- Text input parsing: type "4小时" → converts to 0.5 days
- Consistent display across grid, tooltip, task details
- Short task visibility: minimum 20px width with prominent border

**Examples:**
- 0.125 days → "1 小时" / "1h"
- 1.25 days → "1 天 2 小时" / "1d 2h"
- 3 days → "3 天" / "3d"

### 5. Smart Snapping 🧲
Improved drag-and-drop precision with grid and link snapping.

**Features:**
- Grid snapping: Tasks align to time scale automatically
- Link snapping: Dependencies snap to connection points
- Zero overhead: Uses DHTMLX built-in behavior

## Technical Improvements

- **IndexedDB Schema v2**: Added `baselines` table
- **New Dependencies**: html2canvas@1.4.1 for image export
- **Performance**: 500ms debounce for conflict detection
- **Test Coverage**: New unit and E2E tests for v1.5 features

## Migration Guide

### Automatic Migration
- No user action required
- IndexedDB schema auto-upgrades to v2
- Existing data preserved

### Breaking Changes
None. This is a fully backward-compatible release.

## Known Limitations

1. **Baseline**: Single baseline only (multi-version planned for v2.0)
2. **Export**: PNG only, no PDF support yet
3. **Resource**: No independent resource library (uses custom field)
4. **Large Projects**: Export may take 30+ seconds for 1000+ tasks

## Acknowledgments

- DHTMLX team for excellent Gantt library
- html2canvas contributors for export capability
- Beta testers for valuable feedback
